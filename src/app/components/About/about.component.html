          I am a web developer mainly interested in BackEnd but I have the necessary skills to work wherever I am needed. I also have a high sense of responsibility, I’m proactive, I'm good at working in a team and quick adaptation to new technologies and systems, I am a quick learner and willing to take on tasks of medium and great complexity.
